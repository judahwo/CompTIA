    "\n",
    "A hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. All devices connected by a hub are in a single collision domain and a single broadcast domain, so it must use half-duplex for communication and CSMA/CD. A switch operates at layer 2 of the OSI model and provides more advanced functionality than a hub. A bridge also operates at layer 2. It connects two separate network segments. A router operates at layer 3 and forwards data packets among networks.\n",

    "Answer: B. De-encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "De-encapsulation in networking is performed at the receiver side or destination side as data moves from layer 1 to layer 7 of the OSI model. As information travels up the layers of the OSI layer, information added from the sender’s encapsulation process is removed layer by layer. Tagging typically refers to the process of adding additional information or labels to data packets for specific purposes. Tunneling involves encapsulating one network protocol within another protocol for data transference. Encapsulation is the reverse process of de-encapsulation.\n",

Data is **transmitted** at Layers **5, 6, and 7** of the OSI model. At Layer **4**, the data is **encapsulated into segments**. At layer **3**, the segments are **encapsulated into packets**. At layer **2**, the packets are **encapsulated into frames**. At layer **1**, the frames are **encapsulated into bits**.\n",

    "A switch operates at layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. It uses MAC addresses to forward data between devices on the same network segment. A repeater operates at layer 1, the physical layer, and simply regenerates signals to extend the reach of a network. A router operates at layer 3, the network layer, and forwards data between different networks. A firewall operates at layer 4, the transport layer, or higher layers to filter and control network traffic.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 1:**\n",
    "What protocol is commonly associated with port 53?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **DNS** uses port 53 for domain name resolution queries and responses. This association is well-established in networking protocols. HTTP typically uses port 80. FTP commonly uses ports 20 and 21 for data transfer. SSH is associated with port 22 for secure shell connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:**\n",
    "Which protocol is connection-oriented and ensures reliable data delivery by establishing a virtual circuit between the sender and receiver?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data by establishing a virtual circuit between sender and receiver. UDP is connectionless, suitable for real-time applications but does not guarantee reliable delivery. ICMP is used for network diagnostics, error reporting, and is connectionless, not designed for data transfer. GRE is a tunneling protocol, not inherently providing reliable data delivery; it encapsulates various network layer protocols for routing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:**\n",
    "Which statement accurately describes characterists of a UDP connection? \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **UDP is suitable for real-time applications due to its low latency**: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and does not establish a connection before sending data. This lack of connection setup contributes to lower latency, making it suitable for real-time applications like streaming, gaming, and voice communication. UDP is connectionless, not connection-oriented, and it does not ensure reliable data delivery. UDP does not provide error checking or retransmission of lost packets. UDP does not guarantee in-order delivery of data packets; packets may arrive out of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4:**\n",
    "Which port is commonly used for receiving emails from a mail server?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **Port 110** is commonly associated with the POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) protocol, used for receiving emails from a mail server. Port 80 is typically associated with HTTP, not email protocols. Port 443 is commonly associated with HTTPS (HTTP Secure). Port 25 is commonly associated with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is used for sending emails, not receiving them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5:**\n",
    "Which port and protocol combination(s) are commonly associated with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **RDP** (Remote Desktop Protocol) primarily uses TCP, not UDP, on port 3389. Ports 5060/5061 are commonly associated with SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) used for VoIP, not RDP."
