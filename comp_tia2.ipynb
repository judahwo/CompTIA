    "- Provides logical addressing and routing\n",
    "- IPV4 and IPV6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical Addressing**<br>\n",
    "- Logical addressing is used to identify devices on a network\n",
    "- Examples: IP addresses, MAC addresses, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing**<br>\n",
    "- Packet Switching\n",
    "    - data is divided into packets and then forwarded\n",
    "    - most common form of switching\n",
    "- Circuit Switching\n",
    "    - data is sent over a dedicated circuit\n",
    "    - conastant communication path\n",
    "- Message Switching\n",
    "    - data is divided into meassages and then forwarded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Route Discovery and Selection**<br>\n",
    "- Manually configued as a static route or dynamically through a routing protocol\n",
    "- Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP, etc.\n",
    "- Routing prococals help us decide how data is going to flow, and how the routers are going to communicate that information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connection Services**<br>\n",
    "- Augment Layer 2 connection services to improve reliability and efficiency\n",
    "- Flow control\n",
    "- Packet reordering\n",
    "    - ensures all data reaches receiver correctly at the end desitination\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**<br>\n",
    "- ping most commonly used\n",
    "- sends out packets to check connectivity\n",
    "- traceroute: checks the path of the packet\n",
    "\n",
    "**Layer 3 Devices**<br>\n",
    "- Routers\n",
    "- Multilayer Switches\n",
    "    - regular switch and router combined\n",
    "    - switch is always a layer 2 device unless it is multilayer\n",
    "- IP Addresses\n"
