    "\n",
    "Answer: D. Hub\n",
    "\n",
    "A hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. It operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model. All devices connected by a hub are in a single collision domain and a single broadcast domain, so it must use half-duplex for communication and CSMA/CD. A switch operates at layer 2 of the OSI model and provides more advanced functionality than a hub. A bridge also operates at layer 2. It connects two separate network segments. A router operates at layer 3 and forwards data packets among networks.\n",

    "- C. Tagging\n",
    "- D. Tunneling\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: B. De-encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "De-encapsulation in networking is performed at the receiver side or destination side as data moves from layer 1 to layer 7 of the OSI model. As information travels up the layers of the OSI layer, information added from the sender’s encapsulation process is removed layer by layer. Tagging typically refers to the process of adding additional information or labels to data packets for specific purposes. Tunneling involves encapsulating one network protocol within another protocol for data transference. Encapsulation is the reverse process of de-encapsulation.\n",

    "Answer: B. Layer 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The data layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer OSI model. The data link layer encapsulates data into frames for delivery between nodes on the same network. Data is **transmitted** at Layers **5, 6, and 7** of the OSI model. At Layer **4**, the data is **encapsulated into segments**. At layer **3**, the segments are **encapsulated into packets**. At layer **2**, the packets are **encapsulated into frames**. At layer **1**, the frames are **encapsulated into bits**.\n",

    "D. Firewall\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: B. Switch\n",
    "\n",
    "A switch operates at layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. It uses MAC addresses to forward data between devices on the same network segment. A repeater operates at layer 1, the physical layer, and simply regenerates signals to extend the reach of a network. A router operates at layer 3, the network layer, and forwards data between different networks. A firewall operates at layer 4, the transport layer, or higher layers to filter and control network traffic.\n",

It ensures that data is presented in a format that can be understood by the application layer (Layer 7). Layer 7 is the application layer and is responsible for providing network services to applications.
